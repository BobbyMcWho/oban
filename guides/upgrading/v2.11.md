# Upgrading to v2.11

## Swap the Compound Index (Optional)

Oban uses a single compound index for most queries. The index is comprised of
job `state`, `queue`, `priority`, `scheduled_at`, and `id`. That single index is
flexible enough to power most of Oban's queries. However, the column order is
important, and the order created by Oban's migrations isn't optimal in all
situations.

If you're experiencing slow plugin queries, e.g. the `Stager`, then you may
benefit from swapping the indexes. To do so, create a migration:

```bash
$ mix ecto.gen.migration swap_primary_oban_indexes
```

Within the generated migration module:

```elixir
@disable_ddl_transaction true

def change do
  create_if_not_exists index(
    :oban_jobs,
    [:state, :queue, :priority, :scheduled_at, :id],
    concurrently: true,
    prefix: "public"
  )

  drop_if_exists index(
    :oban_jobs,
    [:queue, :state, :priority, :scheduled_at, :id],
    prefix: "public"
  )
end
```

Be sure to reference the correct prefix if your `oban_jobs` table uses a prefix
other than `public`.
